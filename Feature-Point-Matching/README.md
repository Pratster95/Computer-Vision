Create an interactive application using feature point matching to:
1. Display a video (shown as a series of frames) 
2. Allow the user to “drag a box” on the video
3. Display the feature points (using any feature point detector in opencv 4.2)
4. Recalculate for each frame (using feature point matching / RANSAC) the orientation of the box

Requirements
1. C++ Compiler
2. OpenCV for C++
